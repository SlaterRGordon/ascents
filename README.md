Ascents is currently being developed and will be a log book type application for climbers around the world.

The main goal is to build a community based application where members can share hard ascents they do to their friends, direct message other users and view all of their friends progress in their feed.

So far this is what the application is looking like. I am currently focusing on a component where users can quickly navigate through the different climbs around the world.
